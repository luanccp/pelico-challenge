Hey 👋🏼

My name is Luan, this is the Pelico challenge solution.

#### How to run the project?
```shell
npm i

```
then
```shell
npm run dev

```

## Requirements
- [x] Use either GraphQL (preferred) or REST API to query Github for repositories based on the
user's search input.
- [x] Display the search results as the user types in the search field, possibly with debounce
functionality to avoid excessive API calls.
- [x] Each search result item should have a button to set it as a favorite. If an item is already set as
a favorite, it should be rendered as a favorite again.
- [x] Implement a navigation feature to allow users to access the list of favorites.
- [x] In the favorites list, each item should have a rating evaluation feature, from 1 to 5 , allowing
users to rate their favorite repositories.
- [x] Users should also be able to remove items from the favorites list.

### Extras
- [x] Loading states
- [x] Empty states
